# Rust-VS-Template
## Setup
This is a Visual Studio template for Rust. 
Download this entire project as a zip and then just drag and drop the files at the directory: 
`%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Templates\ProjectTemplates`
Then create a project in VS2019 as you normally would. Run your project to test for inconsistencies.
### Extra information:
I advise not to use any of the project properties of VS2019 except the ones in the General section of the project configuration menu since most of them aren't connected to cargo.
